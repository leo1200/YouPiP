# YouPiP
This is a tiny JavaFx application for pip-view for YouTube.
Use YouTube links or search for videos (YouPiP will use Googles "IÂ´m feeling lucky" feature).
Some music videos may not work in embed mode.

Use the .jar in the out/artifacts folder or build from source.

Predecessor of [pip](https://github.com/leo1200/pip).
